# The (slightly modified) PGDay Bastard Example for Android

This is the Android version of the examples I did at PhoneGap Day EU 2012. 
I modified them slightly to fit github (and Android of course). Enjoy and 
please give feedback if the examples can be improved or I've missed something. 
The original iOS version can be found at: [PGPlugins GitHub repositiry](https://github.com/rohdef/PGPlugins/).

Most changes is quite small. Most notably the events I use in example 4 now 
uses callbacks over document and window events, thus obsoleting the old example 6. 
Example 4 and 5 have been merged due to it being trivial in this approach.
